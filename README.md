# uberContainer

Older codebase.  One of my first golang projects. 

Not current in use anywhere.  Use at your own risk.

Initially developed to be able to reference an uploaded file in a couple of different systems.  

In the different systems needed to be able to drag and drop a file to upload it.

If were to redo now days would probably have this as an extremely basic UI to upload to a block store.
